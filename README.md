# phybase
PHYBASE provides functions to read, write, manipulate, simulate, estimate, and summarize phylogenetic trees (gene trees and species trees). The major features of Phybase include:

• Read and write sequences in Nexus and Phylip format. • Read and write trees in Nexus and Phylip format. • Summarize trees. • Simulate DNA sequences from gene trees • Simulate gene trees from a species tree under the multispecies coalescent model. • Single locus and multilocus bootstrapping (Seo 2008). • Calculate the probability density function of a set of gene trees given a species tree. (Rannala and Yang 2003) • Manipulate trees. • Estimate species trees using STAR/STEAC (Liu et al 2009a and 2009b), and MT (maximum tree) (Liu et al 2009c). Model selection and validation of the substitution models.
